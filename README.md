# NoMoveShackle
Simple addon for Turtle WoW that disables movement keys while the player is under the effect of Shackles of the Legion during the Mephistroth encounter in Kara40.

The Addon temporarily removes the keybinds, so you must not be pressing/holding the left mouse button or using any movement keys when it disables them or they will be locked on. This is a limitation in the API and can't be eliminated.
